## What's Going On

- 🔐 I’m currently working in the field of threat detection.  
- 📊 I’m focusing on understanding SIEM platforms like Splunk and ELK more deeply.  
- 🛠️ I’m passionate about implementing, analyzing, and writing detection rules for attacks — especially in Linux environments.  
- 🌐 Alongside all of this, I have a strong interest in networking and its security aspects.

- ❤️ I love books and always try to read more of them.

⚙️ I also maintain a few open-source projects:

- [**Crow SandBox**](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/Crow) – When I find the time, I enjoy working on this project.  
- [**Web Fishing**](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/WebFishing) – A phishing simulation project; phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data.  
- [**Detect Overflow**](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/DetectOverFlow) – This project uses a debugger to monitor function calls and returns. It prints a warning message if an overflow is detected — an interesting and educational idea.
