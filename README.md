### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on MySelf.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ and Linux internals.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on C/C++ projects about linux.
- 💬 Ask me about C/C++, python, linux and Books :)
- 📫 How to reach me: SOON

:heart: I LOVE books and try reading its:

- [READING-LIST](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/Reading-Book/blob/main/README.md) - All of the books that i readed during life.


⚙️ I also maintain a few open-source projects: 

- [Web Fishing](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/WebFishing) - Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data.
- [Detect Overflow](https://github.com/CheraghiMilad/DetectOverFlow) - An interesting and attractive idea is to use a debugger to monitor the functions called and their returns in the program and print the appropriate message if an overflow occurs.
